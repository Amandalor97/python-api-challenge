Helllo, in this repository you will find my homework for the Module 6 Challenge. This homework has been made with the help of differents sources: Tutor, Xpert Learning Assistant, TA, my teammates Yesmelin P. and Marisol T. & and myself Amanda Lor.

Assignment: 

Part 1: WeatherPy
Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

-Latitude vs. Temperature

-Latitude vs. Humidity

-Latitude vs. Cloudiness

-Latitude vs. Wind Speed

You should create the following plots:

-Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

-Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

-Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

-Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

-Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Part 2: VacationPy

1-Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

2-Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21

Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s

Zero cloudiness

(I followed the example)

3-Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.

4-For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.

5-Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
